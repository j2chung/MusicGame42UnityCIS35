# Unity Rhythm Game
This is a rhythm game made using unity. The game uses midi files to take in beat maps. May be a little buggy at times when you input a keystroke to hit a note because unity is not built to make these kinds of games. Otherwise, the game is playable. Everything works, besides a few features that will be added later, but it is not a priority. Almost all of the sprites/graphics in the game are made by me, but feel free to take them.

# Unimplemented/Bugged features:
High score function was implemented, but does not work.
Will implement a way to swap keys.
Make game look much more appealing with other gameplay features
